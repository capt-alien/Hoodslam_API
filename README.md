**Customer API project for BEW1.2 2.27.19

I am creating an API to track fighters from the Oakland based professional wrestling federation Hood-slam!

The Fighter resource will have the following fields:
id
name
style/theme
affiliation
total matches
total wins
titles

Afterwards the fighters will then be able to create posts and comment on other fighters posts

All testing will be done in postmanðŸ˜…
